        <p>My time at Fire Island was absolutely amazing! Lucious green grass and beautiful trees as far as the eye can see. The air was especially crisp and refreshing during our visit. If you walked further down you would arrive at the beach</p>
        <p>This beach had clear waters and it was the perfect temperature to go for a swim. There were plenty of hiking trails and I spotted so much diverse wildlife. We saw all kinds of birds, chipmunks, and tons of really cool insects.</p>
        <p>Overall, the Fire Island Park was a great experience and I can't wait to come back!</p>
